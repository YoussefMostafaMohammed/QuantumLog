# QuantumLog: A Telemetry & Logging System

> QuantumLog is a scalable, multithreaded telemetry and logging system written in Modern C++17; designed with best architectural and implementation practices in mind.  
> It leverages both the power of Modern C++ and industry-standard libraries such as vSOMEIP and DLT to provide robust, high-performance logging and trace capabilities.

## Features
- Support for multiple sources of data: through a file, a socket, or Ethernet/Wi-Fi via vSOMEIP.
- Intuitive data formatting.
- Ability to display or store logs into multiple sinks: on the console, in a file, or exported to an AUTOSAR-compliant DLT Viewer.
- Thread-safe architecture designed for scalability and real-time telemetry.
